# Transformer-Based Atmospheric River Segmentation Model from Climate Reanalysis Data

This repository contains multiple projects related to Atmospheric River (AR) segmentation based on deep learning models.

## Overview

We apply semantic segmentation models to detect and analyze Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) in climate data. The repository includes two model families:

- **MaskFormer**: Transformer-based segmentation model using mask classification.
- **ChannelViT**: Vision Transformer variant designed to handle multi-channel climate variables.

## Main Features

- Multi-channel climate data processing (e.g. TMQ, U850, V850, PSL)
- Patch-based training pipelines
- Experiment tracking for AR segmentation performance
- Code organized for reproducibility and further model extension
